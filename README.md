Basically Monopoly with a twist.

## Dev environment setup

1. Get [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3125/).
2. Create a folder where you store this code. It's up to you where to store it.
3. For different OS
    - Linux (GUI, may differ from desktop to desktop): Open the folder, then right-click on the empty space and "Open with Terminal".
    - Windows 10: Open the folder, then click on "File", then on "Open Windows PowerShell".
    - Windows 11: Open the folder, then right-click on the empty space and "Open in Terminal".
